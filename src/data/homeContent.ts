      'SWVA Can Code is an initiative that encourages rising 5th to 12th grade students to create and develop web applications that aim to solve important problems or take advantage of opportunities within their communities. This regional initiative provides an opportunity for young students to engage in the process of designing and prototyping these apps. By participating in this program, students are able to contribute to their communities and make a positive impact through technology. The program focuses on empowering students to identify challenges or opportunities in their communities and find innovative solutions through coding. SWVA Can Code not only provides valuable skills in web development but also fosters creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration among young minds.',
